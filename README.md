# Sustainable-Energy-Analytics
This project analyzes two decades of global sustainable energy data (2000–2020) to uncover trends, correlations, and forecasts using Python, R, and Power BI.  
## 🚀 Highlights
- Cleaned and transformed 3,600+ records with up to 58% missing values
- Forecasted energy consumption (R² = 91.9%) and CO₂ emissions (R² = 99.1%)
- Built interactive Power BI dashboards by region, GDP, and emissions
- Delivered insights on policy gaps and investment opportunities

## 🛠 Tech Stack
**Tools**: Power BI, Python, Scikit-learn, R, SQL  
**Techniques**: Forecasting, Regression, Bivariate Analysis, Dashboarding
